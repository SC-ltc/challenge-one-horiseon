# Horiseon Code Refactor Project

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to take existing code and perform refactoring to make it more accessible to both our client and visitors to the page. The accessibility was improved by replacing any non-semantic HTML elements with semantic ones, consolidating and renaming CSS selectors, and adding descriptions to the images.
